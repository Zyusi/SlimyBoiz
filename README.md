# SlimyBoiz
A PC platforming game, currently a demo built in unity. 

Note Initial readme was taken and initally run on UQ repository

# Reason for this Setup
These folders act as substitutes for a repository as because we went a bit over the 20mb limit we have been locked out by hooks setup by UQs IT. The Slimeyboiz-Game and SlimeyBoiz-website represent our git. We have contacted them about this issue but it has not been resolved in time so our git is still up however it is frozen. We have attempted to clear the data files from the hidden history folder, completely wipe the history and tied to restart the git. However with these hooks in all pushes are rejected even if the pushed files reduce the repositories size significantly. For more information see TheShiveringCrew’s emails.

# What we are trying to do with these folders
The Slimeyboiz-Game and SlimeyBoiz-website represent our git. These folders are set up to be similar to the repository in the way they do not contain large assets such as images, these are kept in a separate folder and the two projects (website and game) both have a change logs, however, these may not contain the same level of detail git pushes. The Game also contains older versions  

# What the Files are
C# Scripts: scripts we have written that are used by the scene and are attached to game objects
Scene file: main unity file contains all information about the gameObjects and how they interact
MetaFiles: unity files that contain unity information on the file they are named after.

# If You Want To build The Project Yourself
To build the unity project yourself download unity and create a new project. Then combine the image assets linked below and the scripts, scene files and meta files from the SlimeyBoiz-Game folder all into the assets folder of your new project. Then save and build and run it or load a scene by navigating to it and double-clicking in the ‘project’ tab and hitting the play button up the top.

# We Have A demo Built!
